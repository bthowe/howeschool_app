    1. I'd like to change the daily math input to show the daily performance
6. sidebar icons


smaller bugs
1. chart js I'm seeing in console inspect
2. Why aren't the forms validating
3. refactor the pages with some javascript like enter_performance done differently maybe so there aren't as many strange calls to the server.



weekly input could be formatted better so some of the fields fill the page.


vocab issues:
- quiz
    - red and green colors don't pad the image nicely
- practice
    - button padding and spacing: I can't get the buttons centered.
