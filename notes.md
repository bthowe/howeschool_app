Set this repo up in git.
Get the vocabulary working.
Get things set up so calvin can start using it.


Uggh, what is going on to the weekly_form database?



When does the menu on the left reduce to only the study even when I'm in admin when I go to the vocab screen?



get the data entered and the dashboards working
- I'd like to change the daily math input to show the daily performance

chart js I'm seeing in console inspect


Why aren't the forms validating



get the pages with some javascript like enter_performance done differently maybe so there aren't as many strange calls to the server.



sidebar icons


weekly input could be formatted better so some of the fields fill the page.





vocab issues:
- button padding and spacing: I can't get the buttons centered.
- write to database
- group buttons differently
- quiz framework
